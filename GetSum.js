// Think about this logically. If you were going to add, you simply check the bits in which they are both one. Those are the cases where they are 1 and 1 which turns to 0.
// Result is what you would actually get if you don't consider the carry.
// The loop is where I get lost. So basically which each loop it moves the carry to the left because of course it carries over. Then you & it. You use & for some reason.
// If the place is already at 1 and you add the carry it should go to 0 which is xor.
// My mistake, that was just the update for carry. & is here because the next carry will only happen if they are both 1. In which case you still need to shift it. That makes sense. Carry actually becomes 0 when no other places are 1. That actually makes sense.
